# YAMA2
A simple android app to display top 20 movies sorted by either popularity or rating. (Data pulled from www.themoviedb.org)  You must register at https://www.themoviedb.org to receive an API key, and then enter that API key into the appropriate String in Utils/NetworkUtils (String name: mApiKeyValue)  The app will not work without doing this. This is to comply with the API's terms of use.

This is an upgraded version of the original YAMA app created for Udacity's 'Associate Android Developer Fasttrack' course (original:https://github.com/PeterDavidMulligan/YAMA) and was made to demonstrate both a better backend and frontend, and give an overall better UX design.
